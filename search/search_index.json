Vectors Often in math, we have multiple variables to track for each data point. For instance, when we make 2D plots, we use horizontal and vertical coordinate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to represent its location. We can encode this information of a point \\(P\\) into a vector \\[P = \\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\] Here, the position of the numbers in the vector carries information about the coordinate it's describing. The first number describes the horizontal coordinate and the second number describes the vertical coordinate. Vectors have similar properties to standard (real) numbers. Addition, subtraction and multiplication by constants for vectors behave as one would expect \\[\\begin{align} \\begin{pmatrix} a\\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} c\\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} &= \\begin{pmatrix} a + c\\\\ b + d \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ \\begin{pmatrix} a\\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} c\\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} &= \\begin{pmatrix} a - c\\\\ b - d \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ k \\begin{pmatrix} a\\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} &= \\begin{pmatrix} ka\\\\ kb \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align}\\] I am demonstrating these properties with column (vertical) matrices of size two, although matrices can be any size. There are also row (horizontal) vectors. The orientation impacts the way two vectors multiply. Two vectors of equal size can be multiplied together to yield a number. This is called the inner product. \\[\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c\\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = ac + bd \\] Matrices Just like how multiple variables can be stacked in vectors, vectors can also be stacked into matrices. \\[\\begin{gather} \\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\ b & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} e & j \\\\ f & k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ae + cf & aj + bk\\\\ be + df & bj + dk \\end{pmatrix}\\\\ \\end{gather} \\] Again, the matrices here are \\(2 \\times 2\\) , but in general can be any size.

Feel free to suggest additions in the Discord . Research Fellowship at National Institute of Standards and Technology Award: $10,000 - $20,000 Acceptance rate: 20 - 50% Criteria: Incomming and Current Undergraduate Assist with cutting-edge research at NIST working alongside a mentor at the laboratories in either Gaithersburg, Maryland or Boulder, Colorado. The program lasts for 11 weeks over the summer. Students can work one of 6 labs: Communications Technology Laboratory (CTL), Engineering Laboratory (EL), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), and Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML). If you're looking for Physics related research, look into NCNR or MML. I would recommend dorming with others and looking for AirBnB or similar housing to reduce costs. Apply for NIST Gaithersburg or NIST Boulder . Research Experience for Undergraduates Award: ~$5,000 Acceptance rate: Varies Criteria: Undergraduate This is a collection of programs offered by various research universities to allow students to visit and conduct research with professors. Use the NSF tool to search for an REU or browse by subject. REUs are useful for building connections and networking; building connections a university greatly improves your success rate in applying to their graduate program. Oak Ridge National Labs Internship Award: Varies Acceptance rate: Varies Criteria: Highschool - Graduate Various internship programs at ORNL in Tennessee focused on physics and math education. Contains many options for fundamental physics experimental research for undergraduates. Goldwater Scholarship Award: $7,500 - $15,000 Acceptance rate: ~30% Criteria: 2nd or 3rd year Undergraduate Research Scholarship to award undergraduates for excellence in academics. Speak to your university's office of nationally competitive awards to apply. The application includes a personal statement about your experiences and goals, as well as a research proposal or a write-up of previous research. Astronaut Scholarship Award: $15,000 (per year awarded) Acceptance rate: 20-30% Criteria: 2nd or 3rd year Undergraduate Despite its name, this is not a scholarship for Astronauts. It is a competitive research scholarship similar to Goldwater. Speak to your university's office of nationally competitive awards to apply. Application requires an academic resume and a personal statement. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Award: $138,000 Acceptance rate: 16% Criteria: Sciences Major, 4th year Undergrad - 1st year Graduate Research Fellowship for students pursuing PhD in a Sciences field. Very high value scholarship, especially given the relatively high acceptance rate. Refrence letters required. Apply prior to applying to grad schools in October, the GRFP award will be announced in around March - April, which may be early enough to leverage the GRFP to gain admissions into wait-listed graduate schools. National Merit Scholarship Award: $2500 + Full ride to many Universities Acceptance rate: 1.5% Criteria: High School Students have the opportunity to take the PSAT during the third year of high school. The top 8000 scores are considered for the National Merit Scholarship. While the amount awarded is relatively small, many schools will offer full rides (tuition + room) for students named National Merit Finalists.","title":"Opportunities/Funding"},{"location":"opportunity/#opportunities","text":"These opportunities focus on those available to students attending U.S high schools and Universities as these are the ones I am familliar with.
