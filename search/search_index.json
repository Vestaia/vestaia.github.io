Windows Subsystem For Linux 2 Windows has built-in software to allow running of Linux operating systems within windows.

Ubuntu / Windows Download Xilinx Unified/Web Installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Vivado, Vitis, as well as support packages for the boards you intend to work on (you can change this later if you're unsure). Text Editors Here's a list of popular text editors and a brief description. You should use your distro's package manager to install these Visual Studio Code - Feature rich text editor with syntax highlighting and linting for nearly every type of file through extensions. Vim - Ancient text editor that you will spend 2 minutes trying to exit your first time using it. Neovim - Vim but actually usable. Emacs - Imagine like, keyboard shortcuts, but in Einstein notation. Arch Linux Arch is a Linux distribution focused on user controlled maintainence and system configuration. If you are not interested in configuring your own Linux system, other distros such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora are configured by their respective parent companies. This is a supplement to the Official Installation Guide that explains the impact of various decisions you may make during the install process. The first major decision will be partitioning the disks. Two partitions are needed EFI System Partition (ESP - Recommended Size = 498MB): This partition contains a simple filesystem that is widely supported by most devices. We typically want a more complex filesystem for the Linux system, however these are rarely supported by most devices' firmware. Hence, a seperate partition, the ESP, is used to store applications and drivers that allow us to read and boot the Linux system. Linux System Partition (root - Recommended Size >= 100GB): This partition contains most or all of the files for the operating system. Some of the tools we will use such as Vivado and CERN Root will take a considerable amount of space, hence at least 100GB is recommended. Next, you will need to create a filesystem on each partition. Below are my recommendations for the filesystems and a brief explaination. You can look through Wikipedia if you would like a comparison of filesystems. ESP : FAT32 - Universally supported, allows the system to boot from basically any system capable of loading an EFI, uboot, or coreboot. The ESP filesystem should be mounted at /boot if you would like all files required for booting to be stored in the ESP. root : BTRFS - A stable filesystem with checksumming to ensure silent corruption is impossible. It also supports snapshotting and other backup features which is important for a development environment. Supports transparent filesystem compression and encryption. In order to boot the system, you have a few options. rEFInd (Recommended): A user-friendly bootloader that has an automated install process and requires no additional configuration. rEFInd will automatically detect operating systems available to your system, and handle creating the appropriate paramaters for loading these systems. Grub : A feature-rich bootloader that supports encryption, btrfs snapshot recovery, among other features. However, grub does not auto-detect operating systems at boot time, nor is it able to automatically create parameters to boot. These will need to be configured using a script grub-mkconfig each time you change your system configuration. UEFI Loader (Not Recommended): If you're using a personal computer built in the last couple of decades, chances are your system will have a built-in bootloader. This can be configured using efibootmgr to directly load a Linux operating system from the vmlinuz image. Follow the official installation guide and associated subpages for decisions on other system components, such as desktop environments, shells, etc... These are mostly up to your preference. Linux on T2 Macbooks (2018 and Newer) If you would like to run Linux natively on Macbooks, you will need A patched kernel with SMC and wifi drivers The T2 ARM coprocessor BCE drivers Broadcom Wifi firmware from MacOS Mojave or older And optionally Touchbar and Ambient Light Sensor drivers Fan controller Guides are currently available on T2Linux .

REUs are useful for building connections and networking; building connections a university greatly improves your success rate in applying to their graduate program. Oak Ridge National Labs Internship Award: Varies Acceptance rate: Varies Criteria: Highschool - Graduate Various internship programs at ORNL in Tennessee focused on physics and math education. Contains many options for fundamental physics experimental research for undergraduates. Goldwater Scholarship Award: $7,500 - $15,000 Acceptance rate: ~30% Criteria: 2nd or 3rd year Undergraduate Research Scholarship to award undergraduates for excellence in academics. Speak to your university's office of nationally competitive awards to apply.

Astronaut Scholarship Award: $15,000 (per year awarded) Acceptance rate: 20-30% Criteria: 2nd or 3rd year Undergraduate Despite its name, this is not a scholarship for Astronauts. It is a competitive research scholarship similar to Goldwater. Speak to your university's office of nationally competitive awards to apply. Application requires an academic resume and a personal statement. National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Award: $138,000 Acceptance rate: 16% Criteria: Sciences Major, 4th year Undergrad - 1st year Graduate Research Fellowship for students pursuing PhD in a Sciences field. Very high value scholarship, especially given the relatively high acceptance rate. Refrence letters required. Apply prior to applying to grad schools in October, the GRFP award will be announced in around March - April, which may be early enough to leverage the GRFP to gain admissions into wait-listed graduate schools. National Merit Scholarship Award: $2500 + Full ride to many Universities Acceptance rate: 1.5% Criteria: High School Students have the opportunity to take the PSAT during the third year of high school.
